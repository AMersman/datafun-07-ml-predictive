Last Module of Data Analytics Fundamentals
- In this final module, I employ machine learning (ML). 
- At a high-level, there are three general categories of ML: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. I employ a type of supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model using all available data and use the resulting model (a best-fit straight line) to make predictions.
